 1. Move the contents of "Scripts" to C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua
 Image at the bottom of Readme ^

2. Load Garrys Mod 64-Bit!
3. Open Extreme Injector & Inject "Friendly Bypass" Into Gmod

To run scripts simply open console (~) And type "lua_openscript_cl ScriptName.lua", Replacing Script Name with one from the list.
   
**!!!WARNING!!**! Just be careful, I've tried most scripts and removed the one that got me banned so they should be completely fine now, also don't touch anything from the exploits folders I'm not sure what any of it does yet lmao. ðŸ¤¡


I'm not sure how to use All the scripts but the ones I've tested are.

-odiuumfixed  | bind k ace_menu  
-TrinityHack | bind k +bh_menu  
-Smenu  | bind k sCheat_menu
-smeg  | F11 (I think?)  
-OneMenu | Or this one could be the F11 no clue lmao
