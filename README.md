2. Load Garrys Mod 64-Bit!
3. Open Extreme Injector & Inject "Friendly Bypass" Into Gmod
4. Join Server & Enjoy


To run scripts simple open console (~) And type "lua_openscript_cl ScriptName.lua", Replacing Script Name with one from the list.  
Be carefull, I've tried most scripts and removed the one that got me banned :Clown: ):


I'm not sure how to use All the scripts but the ones i've tested are.

-odiuumfixed  | bind k ace_menu  
-TrinityHack | bind k +bh_menu  
-Smenu  
-smeg  
-OneMenu
